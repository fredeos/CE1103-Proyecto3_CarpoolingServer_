# This file contains main commands for accesing the urls of the RestAPI and accesing information

For the following commands use the URLs in each case: if testing on LAN "http://<device_ip>:<device_port>" or if hosted on a webpage "https://carpooling-rest.azurewebsites.net"
    NOTES:  1. the square braces([]) represent spaces where information should be added
            2. the "< >" are variables since they could change overtime or depending of the host such as IP or PORT
            3. the symbol "{URL}" represent the respective url mentioned previously
            4. the value "type" indicates whether the connecting user is an employee or a driver


-> Create accounts: {URL}/accounts/new/?name=[]&type=[]&mail=[]&password=[]
